**Setup**
1. go to root directory(where "index.html" is located) and run "npm install -g live-server"
2. run "live-server"

**Notes**
1. JSX-mocking components are declared as functions with named arguments. (too hard to write a proper parser)
2. Only a flat level of HTML is supported. i.e. Everything is the direct child of <body></body>
